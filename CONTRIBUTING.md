============

If you want to propose changes to SOFT MANDEL, you should create a new branch
with your ideas, and open a pull request to allow the rest of the company to
discuss your proposed changes. Once at least two others approve the changes,
and no others dissent, it can be merged. If there's company wide disagreement,
some sort of consensus must be reached, and failing that, the PR will be rejected.

If your change adds a new section to SOFT MANDEL, remember to add it to the TOC.
